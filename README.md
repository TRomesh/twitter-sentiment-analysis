Solution to the practice problem : **[Twitter Sentiment Analysis](https://datahack.analyticsvidhya.com/contest/practice-problem-twitter-sentiment-analysis/)**

**Problem Statement**
The objective of this task is to detect hate speech in tweets. For the sake of simplicity, we say a tweet contains hate speech if it has a racist or sexist sentiment associated with it. So, the task is to classify racist or sexist tweets from other tweets.

Formally, given a training sample of tweets and labels, where label '1' denotes the tweet is racist/sexist and label '0' denotes the tweet is not racist/sexist, your objective is to predict the labels on the test dataset.
